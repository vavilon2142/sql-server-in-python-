# sql-server-in-python-
Here i use MySQL database connection with Python SQLAlchemy framework to access the data and make some analysis.
As a database, i use MySQL database "Restaurant". I also uploaded EER diagram to show the relationships between tables (Primary keys, foreign keys).
SQLAlchemy framework perfectly extracts the data with any sort of manipulation.
